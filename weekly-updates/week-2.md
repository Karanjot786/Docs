# Week 2 (8th June to 14th June 2024)

## Activities

- **Linking Properties**:
  - Linked each property in the schema mapping document to specific versions of the TES and WES specifications.
  - Ensured all links were directed to the correct lines in the specifications to maintain precision and accuracy.
- **Feedback Incorporation**:
  - Incorporated initial feedback from the mentor on the schema mapping document.
  - Made necessary adjustments to improve clarity and completeness of the mappings.
- **Detailed Feedback**:
  - Received detailed feedback on the TES to RO-Crate Mapping Table.
  - Updated the mapping table based on the mentor's comments, ensuring all required and optional properties were clearly identified.

## Focus Areas

- Ensuring precision in the mapping work by linking properties to specific versions of the specs.
- Adjusting the schema mapping document based on mentor feedback to enhance accuracy and completeness.
- Clarifying the minimum profile for each mapping and identifying any potential gaps or ambiguities.

## Notes

- Linking properties to specific versions helped maintain accuracy and consistency across the mapping document.
- Mentor feedback was crucial in refining the TES to RO-Crate mapping table and ensuring it met project requirements.
- Regular updates and adjustments based on feedback allowed for a more robust and comprehensive schema mapping document.
