# Project: Python Library for Packaging and Reusing Cloud Computing Workload Traces

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Python library and associated command-line tool for packaging and reusing cloud computing workload traces. The focus is on converting Research Object Crates (RO-Crates) into Task Execution Service (TES) and Workflow Execution Service (WES) payloads, and vice versa. This will enhance reproducibility and transparency of computational analyses on GA4GH-powered cloud infrastructures.
