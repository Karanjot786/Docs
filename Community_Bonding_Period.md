### Meeting with Mentors

Today, I had a kick-off meeting with my mentors. We discussed the project details, initial proposal, milestones, and timelines. We agreed to use asynchronous communication via Slack for ongoing project coordination.

#### Current Focus

Working on [Issue #1](https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/wrroc-ga4gh-cloud-converter/issues/1)


#### Progress Update

I have started working on the mappings for the RO-Crate to TES/WES conversions. The initial focus is on understanding the schemas and identifying the necessary properties.

#### Upcoming Milestones

Complete the initial mapping document by next week.
Share the working document with mentors for feedback.

### Note on Availability

My final exams have started on 10 May and will continue until 27 May 2024. During this period, I will be focusing on my exams but will continue to make progress on the project over the weekends.

### Next Steps

Finalize the mapping document based on the feedback from mentors.
Continue working on Issue #1 with a focus on implementing the initial conversion functions.

### Communication

I will keep providing updates on Slack and through GitHub issues as we move forward. Looking forward to making significant progress now that my exams are completed.
